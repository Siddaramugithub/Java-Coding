Disadvantages of SQL:
	SQL doesnâ€™t provide the programmers with a technique of condition checking, looping and branching.
	SQL statements are passed to Oracle engine one at a time which increases traffic and decreases speed.
	SQL has no facility of error checking during manipulation of data.

Features of PL/SQL:
	PL/SQL is basically a procedural language, which provides the functionality of decision making, iteration and many 	   more features of procedural programming languages.
	PL/SQL can execute a number of queries in one block using single command.
	One can create a PL/SQL unit such as procedures, functions, packages, triggers, and types, which are stored in the    	      database for reuse by applications.
	PL/SQL provides a feature to handle the exception which occurs in PL/SQL block known as exception handling block.
	Applications written in PL/SQL are portable to computer hardware or operating system where Oracle is operational.
	PL/SQL Offers extensive error checking.

Difference between SQL and PLSQL?
SQL:
	SQL is a single query that is used to perform DML and DDL operations.
	It is declarative, that defines what needs to be done, rather than how things need to be done.
	Execute as a single statement.
	Mainly used to manipulate data.
	Cannot contain PL/SQL code in it.

PLSQL:
	PL/SQL is a block of codes that used to write the entire program blocks/ procedure/ function, etc.
	PL/SQL is procedural that defines how the things needs to be done.
	Execute as a whole block.
	Mainly used to create an application.
	It is an extension of SQL, so it can contain SQL inside it.
